<p><img src="Grand Canyon Photo.jpg" width="295" height="200">For a lot of the things I did and sights I saw in each of these states starting with
the Grand Canyon in Arizona, that would be that I<img src="Grand Canyon Photo 2.jpg" width="295" height="200" align="right">drove around to
different areas of the canyon along with also hiking down into them and back up the same way as well.  What I ended up seeing during each of those hikes and
drives was lots of various different sights with taking some photos of them which created this overall feeling of happiness and amazement in me from all of that
with everything I saw from this well-known landmark that also made me feel really big when I was up at the top of the canyon looking down, and really small
when I was very far down the hike towards the more bottom of the canyon looking up.  Along with that, I also felt really happy and lucky that I got to visit one
of Americaâ€™s most well-known landmarks as well.</p>

<p><img src="Hollywood Sign.jpg" width="160" height="255">For the other state of California, I got to go
see the Hollywood sign, go and swim at a lot of its beaches,<img src="Golden Gate Bridge.jpg" width="295" height="200">
walk across the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge, and even also see all of San Francisco at the top of a hill as well.  When it comes to how all
of this made me feel personally, that would be really happy, amazed, excited, and also really big as well from being at the top of that hill looking
out towards San Francisco from that high up.</p>

<p><img src="Fountain.jpg" width="295" height="200">When it comes to that other state of Illinois in Chicago,<img src="Chicago Willis Tower.png" width="130" height="190">
I did a lot of walking around the city and saw the Willis Tower where I got to go to the top of it, and also some other cool things as
well with taking some photos of them.  When it comes to how I felt overall from seeing all of this during my trip there, that would be
really happy, amazed, and also really small as well when I was standing right near a lot of these sights and structures along with feeling
really big too when I was at the top of that Willis Tower Building looking out at the city of Chicago from that high up.</p>
