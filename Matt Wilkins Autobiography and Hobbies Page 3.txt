<p><img src="Hallgrimskirkja Church.jpg" width="140" height="240">For some of the things I did in Iceland, that would be that I went to 
the Hallgrimskirkja Church where I got to go<img src="Hallgrimskirkja Church View.jpg" width="310" height="210">to the top of it,
I got to go swimming in the Blue Lagoon, and I also did a lot of walking around with exploring the city I stayed in of Reykjavik too.
For how I felt from all of this personally, that would be really happy and lucky that I got to go on this trip to Iceland
and do all of these fun activities along with also feeling really big as well from being at the top of that Church with
feeling really small too when I was standing outside near it.</p> 

<p><img src="Eiffel Tower.jpg" width="140" height="230">For France, I got to see the Eiffel Tower, and some other<img src="Louvre Museum.jpg" width="295" height="170">
places, sights, and structures as well<img src="Sacre-Coeur Basilica.jpg" width="265" height="170">including the
Sacre-Coeur Basilica, and even the Louvre Museum.  The way that I personally felt when seeing all of this was really small when I was
standing close to all of these tall structures along with also feeling really big when I went to the top of the Sacre-Coeur Basilica as well.
Along with that, I also really enjoyed this trip overall and felt very lucky and happy to be able to go all the way to France to see all of
this.</p><img src="Sacre-Coeur Basilica Top View.jpg" width="208" height="160">

<p><img src="London Tower Bridge.jpg" width="235" height="180">For the other country of the United Kingdom,
I<img src="Mountain.jpg" width="235" height="180">did a lot of hiking to the top of<img src="Edinburgh Castle.jpg" width="235" height="180"> 
some big hills with looking out everywhere of how far I could see from how high up I was with also driving around a lot with seeing some
really tall mountains as well.  Along with that, I also did a lot of walking around in the two places that I stayed at as well of Scotland and London where I saw a lot of sights and
structures with some of those being the Edinburgh Castle, the Shard Building, the Big Eye Ferris Wheel, and even the London Tower Bridge as well.
When it comes to how all of this made me feel personally overall, that would be really small when I was standing close to all of these sights and structures
with also feeling really big as well when I was at the top of some of them.  Also, I felt really happy and lucky that I was able to go on this trip and had a lot of fun on it.</p>
